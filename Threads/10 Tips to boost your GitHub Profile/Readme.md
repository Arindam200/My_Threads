‚úÖ 10 Tips to boost your GitHub Profile

A Thread üßµ‚¨áÔ∏è


1. Well-written ReadMe file

   Adding a ReadMe is the simplest way to boost the visual appeal of your profile. Setting up a profile ReadMe is simple: Create a public repository with a name that matches your Github username and add a ReadMe.mdfile in its root.

   Here is an example :
   
2. Contribute to open-source

   One of the most excellent strategies to create an exceptional GitHub profile is contributing to open-source projects. Participating in open-source projects shows your teamwork abilities and lets the hiring manager know how effective you are in teams.
   
3. Pin your favorite repositories

   GitHub comes with a feature of pinning repositories on your profile page so that when people visit your profile, they will see those repositories first. This function is useful for showcasing the items you wish to highlight.
   
4. Organize and share your repositories

   Never neglect to manage your repository. For your projects, be careful to have neatly structured repositories. The repository may be made more interesting by adding information, tags, and a description.
   
5. Add a Contribution Graph

   The contribution graph will update your daily activity on your GitHub profile. It's a nice way to showcase if you are active frequently and doing some contributions to projects.
   
6. Add your Projects

   Any of your projects could earn you a fortune if they were implemented end-to-end on GitHub and had a well-written, step-by-step ReadMe. You and your project might reach new heights thanks to contributions from all over the world.
   
7. Use commit messages

   Always be clear and concise when describing what you contributed and why it was important or valuable. A simple "I fixed this" message won't provide anyone with any insight into your thought process or approach, two things that recruiters are looking for.
   
8. Icons & Badges

   The greatest approach to interact with people and drive more traffic to your social media accounts is by adding your social media handles to your GitHub profile. Using badges and symbols, you may also add details about the tech stack you are familiar with.
   
9. Use your Stats Card

   Another typical profile improvement is adding Stats cards on your GitHub page. This is a quick way to see all of your GitHub statistics in a visually appealing manner. You may monitor your GitHub Streak as well.
   
10. Side hustles 
<br> Additionally, you may manually add your articles and side activities to your profile's README file or use GitHub Actions to automate the process. By showing your amazing side projects, you can attract recruiters.
